### Main configuration, with some examples
### The default values are shown as comments

### Default size
#Width=640
#Height=320

### Size of the application icons
#IconSize=48

### The Qt Stylesheet style, located in ~/local/share/qiq or /usr/share/qiq
### There's a sample in /usr/share/doc/qiq
#Style=default.css

### Where the notifications show up, negative offsets mean right/bottom aligned
#NotificationOffset=@Point(-32 32)

### The terminal emulator used in case an application hints that it needs one
### Defaults to the $TERMINAL environment variable (not! "$TERM")
TERMINAL=urxvt -rv -geometry 128x25 -e
#TERMINAL=$TERMINAL

### If a command prints escape sequences (colors) it needs o be coverted to
### html, by default ansifilter and the aha are used when found
### aha is in the repos, but looks unmaintained and you caanot configure the colors
AHA=ansifilter -f -H --map /home/seth/.local/share/qiq/ansifilter.map
#AHA=ansifilter -f -H
#AHA=aha -x -n

### Whatever you enter, if it's not a proper command it will be passed as stdin to a
### last resort process which in practice makes sense to be a calculator but could be anything
### By default qalc and bc are used when found.
#CALC=qalc -f -
#CALC=bc -ilq

### The external process that can be used to complete program features
### The existing part of the command is passed as a single variable including whitespace as entered
### zsh-autocomplete can be found in /usr/share/doc/qiq
### It's minimally adapted from https://github.com/Valodim/zsh-capture-completion/blob/master/capture.zsh
CmdCompleter=zsh-autocomplete
#CmdCompleter=
### Only the parts before the separator are inserted (it delimits comments from the zsh autocompletion)
CmdCompletionSep=" --"
#CmdCompletionSep=

### Qiq can show file previews (currently only for images) when selecting files for selected commands
### The input has to begin with this command - here it's an alias for a wallpaper setting feh call
PreviewCommands=setwp

### Permanent files are stored on exit and frequently w/ a timer to collect multiple changes
### The permanent locations for the command history defaults to empty, ie. isn't stored
HistoryPath=/tmp/.seth.qiq.history
#HistoryPath=
### The permanent locations for the todo list defaults to your $XDG_DATA_HOME
### but you could use a tmpfs and only sync that on shutdown
TodoPath=/tmp/.seth.qiq.todo
#TodoPath=$XDG_DATA_HOME/qiq/todo.txt

### Qiq is supposed to show up, take keyboard input, do something and hide.
### Unfortunately the window managers have a word on that, so there're various strategies
### to deal with that.
### By default the WM is bypassed, but that will often lead the WM to be confused about the active window
### ===> also see the annotated wmhacks script in the documentation!!!
### supported flags are popup,grabkeyboard,bypass
### not bypassing the WM will get you more control over the window in WM rules but typically
### you will not be able to show qiq over an active fullscreen window - so this is the overall best strategy
#WMHacks=bypass


### The gauges to be used on the status display
Gauges=Temp,Clock,RAM,Battery,Network
#Gauges=
### And the extra-fancy font for their labels
GaugeFont=FuturismRegular
#GaugeFont=

### Aliases allow you to define or change commands.
### nb. that your zshrc or bashrc configs are irrelevant here, you NEED to define qiq aliases in this config!
[Aliases]
### simple udisks helper in an overll helper script, exposed directly via alias
disk=.qiqctl disk
### Make the find results a list by default
find=#find
### There's no tty device which will make most commands not use colors unless you enforce them
grep=grep --color=always
ip=ip -c
### less isn't a particularly useful command in this context, so we replace it with source highlight
less=source-highlight -c /home/seth/.local/share/qiq/syntax.css -o STDOUT -i
### DO NOT USE PACMAN TO INSTALL STUFF! It requires an interactive shell!
### But when checking package contents etc. et pp, we want to see that and as a list
pacman=#pacman
### since I often open local files w/ sqriptor and I know I don't care about sqriptor's stdout
### make it close the dialog right away so I can use the editor
sqriptor=!sqriptor
### you can also define bang-style aliases where the token "%s" gets replaced by the parameters of the
### command, eg. the below allows to enter "ddg foo bar" to open a ddg search in vivaldi (and ignore the process)
### nb. the escaped \" quotes \" to cover whitespaces in the search token!
ddg=!vivaldi \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s\"


######################################################################################################
### The Gauges, every gauge has 
### * up to three rings
### * one label
### * one tooltip and
### * left+right mousebutton and wheel actions
### Some annotated example configs ###################################################################

### Temperature, nb. that your hwmon path for the CPU sensor can - and likely will - differ
[Temp]
### Where to anchor this (any meaningful combination of left, right, top, bottom and center will work)
Align=topright
### Offsets
OffsetX=-32
OffsetY=32
### Size in pixels
Size=128
### How frequent to update the timer, defaults to every second (1000ms)
# Interval=1000
### Outmost ring
### Where to read the current value
Source1=/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input
### The range relevant to the value, in the dimensions of that value
Min1=0
Max1=80000
Threshold1=>60000
ThreshMsg1=CPU hot at %m°C
### Colors from low to high values (blue to red) will be HSL interpolated
ColorLow1=#1793d0
ColorHigh1=#d01717
### Second ring, different sensor and range but same principle
Source2=/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon7/temp1_input
Min2=0
Max2=100000
ColorLow2=#1793d0
ColorHigh2=#d01717
### The label
### %p[1-3], %v[1-3], %dv[1-3], %cv[1-3] and %mv[1-3] get replaced by the
### percentage, value, value/10, value/100 and value/1000 of the respective ring [1-3]
Label=%mv1°C
### The tooltip can be a fixed label or dynamically acquired with an executable command in $PATH
### The qiqctl example helper script can be found in /usr/share/doc/qiq
Tooltip=.qiqctl sensors
### Since those commands can be expensive the tooltip can use old values for some miliseconds when shown in rapid succession
# TooltipCacheTimeout=1000
### The left mouse button action is an uninspired TE running top
ActionLMB=urxvt -e top

### Since clock and RAM will be of frequent interest and use specific data, there's special configuration
### so you won't have to poll date or grep /proc/meminfo
[Clock]
### The outmost ring are the seconds, I'm not interested in that, so it's commented
### The gauge will still use the entire space (ie. the second ring gets the full diameter)
#Source1=%clock%
### Minutes, using the same blue color
Source2=%clock%
ColorLow2=#1793d0
ColorHigh2=#1793d0
### Hours, using the same orange color
Source3=%clock%
ColorLow3=#ffb31c
ColorHigh3=#ffb31c
### The clock is centered
Align=center
Size=256
### The clock label supports https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtime.html#toString-1
Label=HH:mm\ndddd\nd. MMM


[RAM]
### The sources for the RAM  follow the pattern "%mem%WHAT" where "WHAT" is any field from "cat /proc/meminfo"
Source1=%mem%MemAvailable
### Send a warning on low RAM
#Threshold1=<1048576
#ThreshMsg1=Available RAM below %p%
### Swap automatically selects the total swap for the range, don't ask me what happens when you're using zswap…
Source2=%mem%SwapFree
ColorLow2=#d01717
ColorHigh2=#8cc716
ColorLow1=#d01717
ColorHigh1=#8cc716
Align=bottomleft
OffsetX=32
OffsetY=-32
Size=128
Label=%p1%\navailable\nRAM
Interval=60000
Tooltip=.qiqctl memstat

[Battery]
Label=󰛕
Source1=/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity
ColorLow1=#d01717
Threshold1=<8
ThreshMsg1=Battery below %p%
ColorHigh1=#8cc716
Interval=60000
Align=topleft
OffsetX=32
OffsetY=80
Size=64

[Network]
Label=
Source2=.qiqctl netstat eth0
Threshold2=<1
Source1=.qiqctl netstat wlan0
Threshold1=<1
RedundantThresholds=true
ThreshMsg1=No Network
ThreshMsg2=No Network
ColorLow2=#1793d0
ColorHigh2=#1793d0
ColorLow1=#d01717
ColorHigh1=#8cc716
OffsetX=112
OffsetY=32
Size=64
Interval=60000
Align=topleft
Tooltip=.qiqctl netstat details

### This would add a gauge with one ring (and no particular configuration)
### That doesn't poll data at all but can be controlled via dbus
### (as can be the other ones except %clock% and %mem%)
### and "qiq set DbusDemo value 5", see the qiq help for more details
# [DbusDemo]
# Source1=%dbus%
